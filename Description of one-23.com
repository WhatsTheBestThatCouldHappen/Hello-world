// One-23.com is a social media site. The basic page is tile-based, where each tile functions like a wiget. When a new user signs up for an account, they are introduced to the format, and a short description of the tiles available to them. Every tile has separate permission settings.
Users are like the Captians of their own boats. Life is a journey, and a boat is an good metaphor, because the whole group will reach their destination, or none of them will reach it. The Captain can invite other people on board, and if they become disruptive the Captain can send them on their way. 
One of the tiles lists the roles of the different people in our lives. We each have our financial go-to-person, our technical or science advisor, our health advisor, our social director, etc. We'll call these people Officers. Initially, all the roles are filled in with the user's screen name. The Captain can add, modify or delete the titles as desired. 
One of the tiles is the user's personal story. He or she may share as much or as little as they want.
Another tile is the user's personal budget, filled in with average values for their demographic. Many of us don't have a financial plan of any kind. Having a budget is a good start. 
There's a callendar tile for planning long-term projects. It will be simple and intuitive to use, and similar to what one might find on BaseCamp or Asana.
