# Hello-world
We need a new Facebook
Not for me, not for you, but for Us.

It's no secret Facebook tracks its users and sells the information to politicians, corporations and governments. One-23.com won't do that. 

Facebook encourages fake news and false scientific claims. Number of clicks is their metric. The most divisive and inflammatory content makes the rounds. One-23.com will keep false and misleading articles from being widely shared.

When people form groups based around common interests (the case with all existing social media platforms) they are trained to be passive consumers of content. When groups form around common goals, people are empowered to create the world we imagine.
